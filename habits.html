	<h1 class="title"> HABits Lab </h1>

	<p1 class="background-info"> <b> Role:</b> Undergrad Researcher <br> 
		<b>When:</b> June 2019 - September 2019 
		<br> <b>Professor:</b><a href ="http://www.nalshurafa.com/" target="_blank"> Nabil Alshurafa </a> <br> 
		<b>Outcome:</b> A paper for the CHI 2021 conference.   </p1>

	<h2 class="subtitle"> BACKGROUND</h2>

	<p2 class="information">Obesity is a major concern in the United States with 40%. Registered Nutritionists who work with patients with obesity currently use the 24-hour diet recall to track caloric intake for a day. The 24-hour diet recall is considered the Gold Standard. <br><br>

	At HABits Lab, we work on wearable mHealth (mobile health). In 2017, HABits Lab conducted a study with 17 participants of varying age, weight, and gender. For three weeks, users were asked to wear a camera located on their non-dominant shoulder in order to capture food consumption. Participants also completed the 24-hour recall with a dietitian. </p2>

	<h2 class="subtitle"> RESEARCH</h2>

	<p2 class="information">During my time at HABits Lab, I annotated about 650 hours of film collected from the 2017 study. By annotating, I was able to collect data on a wide range of items such as: <br>
		- Items that were seen in the video and not in the 24-hour diet recall <br>
		- If the participant was eating alone or with others <br>
		- If the participant was eating at home or out <br>
		- If the participant was looking at a screen during their meal<br>
		- If the video data was indecipherable and why <br> <br>


	Since the lab was planning on doing a second round of the same study with updated technology in fall of 2019, the lab as a whole wanted to learn from the past study. So we were extremely interested in why video data was indecipherable at times. In total, I labeled 647 meals, with 21% being indecipherable. I analyzed the indecipherable items and broke them down into a high level categorization of why they were indecipherable. </p2>

	<p2 class="information"> Knowing the causes of indecipherable data from the camera allowed us to analyze further what factors were at play. We identified three major categories, their frequency, and a recommendation for improvements for the future device. </p2>

	<h2 class="subtitle"> OUTCOME</h2>
	<p2 class="information">  This research was used in a paper with lead author <a href ="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sougata-sen/" target="_blank">  Sougata Sen</a>. The paper is planned to be submitted as a recommendation paper for the 2021 CHI conference. The entirety of the rough draft can be read <a href ="CHI_paper.pdf" target="_blank"> here.
