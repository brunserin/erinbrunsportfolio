	<p1 class="background-info"> <b> Role:</b> Service Designer <br> <b>When:</b> January 2020 - March 2020 <br> <b>Teammates:</b> <a href ="https://www.katherineliu.design/" target="_blank">Katherine Liu</a>,  <a href ="https://www.linkedin.com/in/teephopk/" target="_blank">Float Keerasuntonpong</a>,  <a> Katy Wics</a> <br> <b>Outcome:</b> A service that engages students with a daily question to increase their exposure to politics.   </p1>

	<h2 class="subtitle"> PROBLEM</h2>

	<p2 class="information"> NUVotes is a service at Northwestern University that provides a myriad of resources to help students vote. While Northwestern has one of the highest percentages of eligible students to vote, there is still more to be done.  </p2>

	<h2 class="subtitle"> RESEARCH</h2>

	<p2 class="information"> First, our team considered the possible stakeholders who would be involved with this project. This helped inform the team of who was at risk and who to get feedback from. <br></p2>

	<img class="first" src="stakeholders.png"> <br><br>
​
	<p2 class="information">Next, we conducted <b>contextual inquiries</b> with three students, talked with 8 students using <b>man-on-the-street</b> style interviews, and went on a <b>service safari</b> to the Center for Civic Engagement at Northwestern (the home of NUVotes). <br><br>

	Through our research, we identified two key themes: <br><br>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. A majority of students who do not vote say it is because they feel too “uneducated” to vote. <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. NUVotes provides many resources that students are unaware exist.<br><br>

	Next, we created <b>primary and secondary personas</b> to keep in mind during the design process. </p2>

	<h2 class="subtitle"> IDEATION AND NARROWING </h2>

	<p2 class="information"> The next step was to ideate possible solutions for tackling our key insights. Our team <b>ideated</b> over 100 ideas and then narrowed to our three best ideas. We <b>storyboarded</b> the ideas and presented the ideas to students and stakeholders to test excitement and feasibility.<br></p2>

	<img class="first" src="storyboards.png">


	<h2 class="subtitle"> FINAL DESIGN DIRECTION </h2>

	<p2 class="information"> Our landed on the idea of an application that prompts students to <B>answer a daily political question</B>. If students answer a certain number of questions correctly, they earn a free burrito from the local restaurant, Tomate (a crowd favorite). The application also works as a direct communication line for NUVotes to send students notifications about important deadlines.<BR> <BR>

	We created a <b>journey map</b> of what the process would look like for the user and possible stakeholders at hand.</p2>

	<img class="first" src="journeymap.png">

	<h2 class="subtitle"> BUILD AND TEST </h2>

	<p2 class="information"> Integrated throughout the process of choosing our final design, we built and tested aspects of the design. <BR> <BR>

	By posting in club organizations asking friends to sign up to test our service, we got <B>30 students</B> to sign up to answer a daily question for 3 days. A Google number was to send users a link to a SurveyMonkey that prompted the user with a political question. Throughout the process, we received <B>60% engagement</B>, with no incentive. <BR> <BR>

	We also reached out to possible stakeholders for feedback on the feasibility of the design. We overwhelmingly got positive reinforcement. We put together a service blueprint to present to stakeholders. <BR></p2>

	<img class="first" src="blueprint.png">


	<h2 class="subtitle"> TAKEAWAYS</h2>
	<p2 class="information">In order to come to our final design direction, we combined several ideas from things that currently existing to ideas that were brought up in the ideation process. I learned the value of saying <b>“yes, and”</b> to all ideas and growing upon current processes that have proved to be productive.  </p2>
